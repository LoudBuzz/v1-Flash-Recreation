Hello everyone, alottu here.
So here's all the recreations fla's
OBVIOUSLY they're not accurate at 100%
I couldn't find the original pictos or shirt symbols anywhere, so they are pngs from v1 of the app.

A big thanks to Joalor64, who downloaded all the files from the Wayback Machine 
and modified them to look like the official 2018 site.

A big thanks to Seal, who made the animation renderer, This was a huge help in making this 
look like the original

If you want, you can download this project and modify it to your liking so that Flash mods don't die!
Little miss (Chrismas Variant) is on the way.
